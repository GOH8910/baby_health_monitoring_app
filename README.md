# baby_monitoring_app

The Baby Monitoring App is designed for real-time monitoring of blood parameters using Bluetooth-connected sensors and CSV data inputs. The app provides dynamic graph plotting, interactive data exploration, and CSV data management through a Flutter front end and a Rust back end.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

This app was developed as part of our third-year Software Engineering module group project at Imperial College London. The goal was to create a cross-platform baby monitoring system that connects to external Bluetooth sensors to visualise real-time blood parameter data.

We collaborated as a team of five, with responsibilities split across frontend, backend, Bluetooth integration, and report writing. My contributions included [briefly mention what you worked on â€“ e.g., live plotting, UI, Rust integration, etc.].

The final technical report, which details our design decisions, architecture, and testing strategies, is also included in this repository under `/report/final_report.pdf`.

## Code Locations

In terms of the locations of the source code for this project, the Dart frontend source files are located in the "lib" folder and the Rust source files are located in the "rust" folder. All other files are automatically generated by flutter_rust_bridge on the creation of a new project and none of those files have been touched since creation. Additionally, any source files that have a message at the top saying that they are automatically generated were not touched. All the unit tests are done in the "test" folder.
